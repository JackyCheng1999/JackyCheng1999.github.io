My name is Jiaqi Cheng.

I am a third-year computer science PhD student at University of Wisconsin, Madison. I am fortunate to be advised by professor [Rishab Goyal](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~rishab/). My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of cryptography, particularly proof systems (fundamental to blockchain and cloud computing), and the development of new protocols.

I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science with highest honors from UIUC, where I conducted research under the guidance of the esteemed Professor [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/), focusing on computational geometry and approximation algorithms.
