My name is Jiaqi Cheng.

I am a senior-year undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am lucky to be advised by venerable [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/). My interest is in theoretical computer science, design and analysis of algorithms, and approximation algorithms.
