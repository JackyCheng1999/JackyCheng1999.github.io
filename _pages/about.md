My name is Jiaqi Cheng.

I am now a PhD student at University of Wisconsin, Madison. I am currently working with professor [Rishab Goyal](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~rishab/). My research focuses on the theoretical foundations of cryptography, especially proof systems, and the development of new protocols.


I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from UIUC, where I conducted research with Professor [Sariel Har-Peled](https://sarielhp.org/), focusing on computational geometry and approximation algorithms.
